**Intelligent Vision for Smarter Streets**  

## 📌 About the Project  
UrbanPulse AI is a deep learning-powered object detection system that identifies key urban elements such as vehicles, pedestrians, poles, sidewalks, and road markings. Designed to enhance city planning, traffic monitoring, and smart surveillance, this project leverages a custom-trained YOLOv5 model for real-time analysis.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ Detects various street elements, including:  
   - **Pole** (Streetlights, traffic lights, and utility poles)  
   - **Truck** (Small and large trucks)  
   - **Car** (Omni vans, cars)  
   - **Bus** (Government, private, or similar-looking buses)  
   - **Bicycle** (Bicycles and e-bikes)  
   - **Auto** (Auto rickshaws of any color)  
   - **Van** (Loading vehicles, ambulances, food vans)  
   - **Person** (Toddler, young, adult)  
   - **Sidewalk** (Clearly marked footpaths)  
   - **Road** (Visible road surfaces)  
   - **Road_cross** (Zebra and yellow road crossings)  

✅ Emotion Detection (Only if confidence >70%):  
   - **HappyFace** 😊  
   - **NeutralFace** 😐  
   - **SadFace** ☹️
